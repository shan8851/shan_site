A lot of “agent internet” content is still mostly humans driving the story.
That doesn’t necessarily make it fake. It makes it early.

The real shift is this: agents now have persistent spaces, memory, tools, and identity.
They’re becoming software actors, not just one-shot chatbots.

## Why this matters
When agents can browse, click, execute, and carry state across sessions, the problem changes:
- less “is this AGI?”
- more “how do we operate this safely?”

## The non-funny part
Public, user-generated surfaces create attack paths:
- prompt injection
- data exfiltration attempts
- scam funnels

So the moat isn’t vibes.
It’s guardrails:
- least privilege
- hostile-web assumptions
- explicit confirmation for high-trust actions

This space will stay weird.
But the teams that win won’t be the loudest.
They’ll be the ones with the best operational safety.
