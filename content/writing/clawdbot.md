I had to jump on the ~clawdbot~ ~moltbot~ OpenClaw bandwagon. This thing is crazy.

### TL;DR

The elevator pitch is *the AI that actually does things* and it is not wrong. Out of the box you can expect

- Runs on your machine
- Interact with the bot from almost any chat app
- Browser control
- Persistent memory
- **Full** system access (if you enable it - start sandboxed)

### My Journey

I've been playing for a few weeks now. Initially via a VPS and since moved to an old linux machine. Some of the workflows and thins I have setup include:
- A daily briefing with the things I care about
  - Quick crypto price update
  - Recent web search and shares top articles on crypto, ai and OpenClaw itself
  - local news and headlines plus weather (lol)
  - Any open reminders I have
  - Reminder of things I have asked to discuss later with the agent
- Daily notes
  - Pings me every night with a summary of what we have done that day
  - weekly cron to summarise the dailies
  - monthly cron to summarise the weeklies
  - quarterly, yearly and you get the idea
- Every evening it runs its own mini retro
  - Evaluates what has been working well and what it’s struggled with
  - Suggests improvements to `MEMORY.md` (and other alignment files) for me to approve.
- Then a bunch of the usual boring stuff;
  - Periodic checking of calendar and email and all that jazz

### So what

True, it is not mind blowing stuff. But is is safe and boring things that speed me up and add value. Yeah I had a play and had the agent order something from Amazon, call some friends and family for fun. That's just me having a play around. But my real use case here is have the agent *automate the boring stuff* on my behalf.

There is a lot of hate and a lot of mania around this. Both are probably granted. I would recommend playing around though in whatever limits are comfortable for you. I think everyone will find something useful that can be done with this - the opportunities are honestly endless.

### What's next?

For me. Iterate. Keep improving my workflows. Particularly interested in doing things onchain with agents.
