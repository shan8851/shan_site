A few people I work with are telling me about how tough the market is right now. They are correct.

The market can be hard and your execution can still be weak. Treat both as true.

Focus on what you can control: sharper CV, visible portfolio proof, relationship-based networking and repeated interview reps. Complaining about conditions does not increase your hit rate - better positioning does.
