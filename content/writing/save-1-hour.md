If your todo list is constantly growing or worse you don’t have one, don’t increase the effort. Add a better process.

## 1) One takeaway

Stop using AI as only a search box. Instead use it to **execute**.

Most people are still using AI reactively - “Help me with this one thing”. It’s useful, but tiny. The real gains come from running automated loops weekly:

- dump context in
- prioritise
- get clear actions
- execute

The goal is to finish more (of the right) things.

## 2) One workflow

### The 20min weekly AI loop

Run this once weekly - Sunday night is perfect.

#### Step 1 - The Dump (5 mins)

Paste into whatever AI you use:

- your calendar events for the week
- your top priorities
- open tasks you need to keep track of
- any hard constraints (meetings, family, deadlines)

#### Step 2 - Prioritise (5 mins)

Use this exact prompt:

```
You are my execution assistant.
Given my week’s inputs, do 4 things:
1) identify the top 3 outcomes that matter most this week,
2) cut low-impact tasks,
3) convert each top outcome into concrete next actions,
4) produce a daily plan with realistic focus blocks.

Rules:

- be practical, not motivational,
- call out overload and conflicts,
- keep wording short and clear,
- include a “not doing this week” list.
```

#### Step 3 - Execute (10 mins once then daily use)

Take the output from step 2 and put it into whatever system you use (can be notes, tasks, cal, whatever).

Each morning ask AI the following:

```
Given today’s calendar and this weekly plan, what are the top 2 tasks I must finish today?

Return only:
- Top 2 tasks
- First 30-minute action for each
- One thing to ignore
```

That’s it. Keep it boring and repeatable.

### 3) One action for today (max 60mins)

**Do this in 25 minutes today:**

1. Block 25 minutes in your calendar to get your first weekly loop setup.
2. Run the exact prompts above with your real inputs.
3. Pick your top 2 tasks for tomorrow.
4. Delete one low-impact task you were never going to do anyway.

You now have a system, not just another AI tab open.

## Quick note

Today’s post is intentionally simple.

You can push this much further with automation. If you’re comfortable with it, an agent can run this loop for you: collect context through the week, run the weekly plan on Sunday, then send your top tasks each morning.

So after setup, input drops close to zero and execution stays consistent.

If you want that version, [DM me on X](https://x.com/shan8851) and I’ll cover it in a future post.

If this was useful forward it to one person who’d benefit.
