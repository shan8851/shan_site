I’m returning to Solidity for one reason: I need deeper blockchain fluency, not just stronger frontend skills. The plan is simple: refresh fundamentals, ship small contracts, and learn by deploying, not by collecting tutorials.

Current execution path: CryptoZombies for fast reps, then build a few real dApps with modern tooling and iterate in public.
