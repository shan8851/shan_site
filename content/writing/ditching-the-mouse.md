I’m moving to keyboard-first workflows because it compounds speed across every coding day. Vim is part of that, but the real goal is reducing context switches and pointer friction.

Execution is phased: vim motions inside VS Code first, terminal tooling daily, full editor migration only if it improves throughput without hurting delivery.
