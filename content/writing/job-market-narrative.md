There’s a lot of noise right now about AI causing mass job loss.

The job market *is* rough. AI *is* part of the story. But no, AI is not replacing humans at scale yet.

The bigger shift is this: people who can use AI are replacing people who can’t.

That’s what’s actually happening in teams right now. Same headcount, different output. Same roles, different expectations. If you can ship faster, think clearer, and automate the boring stuff, you become very hard to replace.

Also worth saying: some of this is just delayed correction. A lot of companies over-hired during the pandemic. The market is now unwinding that.

So yes, jobs are changing. Fast.

Let me say it again:

**AI won’t replace workers (yet), but workers who use AI will replace workers who don’t.**

So what should you do?

• **Use AI daily, not occasionally.** Treat it like your default copilot, not a novelty tab.
• **Test multiple models on real work.** Don’t ask toy questions. Give it the messy stuff you actually do.
• **Push until it breaks.** Most early failures are skill issues, not model limits.
• **Build repeatable workflows.** Save prompts, checklists, and templates so you can reuse for quick wins.
• **Use it everywhere.** Research, write, code, review, debug, document.

There’s still time to catch up.

But the gap is widening already.
