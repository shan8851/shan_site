A 45-minute daily standup is process debt. Status sharing should be constrained, and problem-solving should happen in smaller follow-up threads or chats.

Use strict async updates for yesterday/today/blockers, then spin up targeted calls only when blocked work needs collaboration.

Honestly most standups should be run async. Save face time for things that are more valuable - including bonding with your team if in a remote setting. It is not that facetime is not important, but reeling off exactly what you did yesterday is helpful to nobody and wildly inefficient.
