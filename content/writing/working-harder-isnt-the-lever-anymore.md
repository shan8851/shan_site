Hard work still matters.
It’s just not the edge anymore.

The edge is leverage: clear thinking, repeatable systems, and AI that helps you ship faster.
If you try to outwork people who have leverage, you lose.

## What to do this week
Pick one task you already do every week.
Turn it into a loop:
- draft with AI
- run it for real
- automate one step
- improve it with feedback

That’s the shift: don’t just ask AI for answers. Build small systems that get better each run.

## The practical point
Using AI for notes and search is fine, but it won’t change your trajectory.
Using AI to plan, de-risk, execute, and review repeatedly will.

Hard work is table stakes.
Leverage is the differentiator.
