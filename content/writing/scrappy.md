My bottleneck is not knowledge. It is over-planning.

Countless hours wasted planning these *perfect* learning systems instead of shipping and iterating. Severe paralysis by indecision is the result and close to zero momentum.

The fix is execute -> learn cycles: ship contracts, docs, and small backend pieces every week, then adjust from real results.
