To many people work life balance seems impossible if they want to be at the top. Initially this thought tracks well. If you want to do something great then it takes sacrifice. There is no getting around that.

However, high achievement and balance can coexist, but not as a daily split. You need to think about it in phases. Push hard where leverage is high, deadlines are looming and you need to move the needle. Identify opportunities where you can rebalance deliberately.

Keep a set of non negotiables that are constant through any phase: family, sleep and baseline fitness. Everything else should be fluid.
