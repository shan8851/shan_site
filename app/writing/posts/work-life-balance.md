## Can high achievers still have balance?

To many work life balance seems impossible if they want to be successful. And for most, this tracks because we all know if you want to achieve something great it takes sacrifice right? Well, yes, but imo work life balance can still be achieved if you just change how you think about it a little.

## What does work life balance look like for me?

For some reason, many people see work life balance as something they should strive for every day, but this doesn't really make sense to me. As I mentioned, to do anything really well, usually takes sacrifice, obsession or more commonly both.

If I think back to when I was teaching myself to code, I spent months in front of the computer, barely watching any TV, never going out with friends and definitely having less sleep than I should have. Is that balance? Of course not.

However I think about work life balance in a more fluid way, I don't care to have the perfect balance of work, life and social everyday - imo it's impossible to achieve and still do really well. Instead I think about it in bursts. For example, I start a new role, I want to hit the ground running quickly, so I work my arse off and put in whatever extra time I can to make sure I do well and get to the level I want. Then maybe the next few months I can ease off the gas and divert my attention to ensuring I still have a social life.

## Long term view

In other words I have the view that balance should be looked at longer term. It is silly to try and give everything equal attention everyday and this just results in being mediocre in all walks of life. Instead I zoom out and think in 10 years time I want to be in a great place career wise, have an active and fulfilled social life and a strong family unit at home.

From there I think of it almost like a product roadmap and break it into sprints. One sprint might be a few months going all in on my career, the next could be strengthening my friendships after the natural neglect that comes from a successful previous sprint and the third might be working on some new skills or interests once my two main areas (work/family) are solid.

## A few constants will be needed

My first iteration of this approach was only somewhat successful. I would take this approach too literally and that can be harmful. There are some things that need to be constant. For most this is probably obvious, but it took me some time to figure out. For me some of these constants are:

- Key family stuff always needs to be a priority. Yes they will accept that sacrifices are being made for the greater good, but you can't just completely switch off from it.
- Health/Fitness - to do your best work you need to be fit, healthy and well rested. I will often have a lighter schedule when deep into some other area, but I have found that maintaining some form of exercise routine and getting decent sleep is essential for success.

## Spoiler - You can have it all

Just not all at once.
