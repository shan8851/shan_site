I've been pondering what tech stack to focus on next. Don't get me wrong, I love working with React and Typescript, but I feel like it is time to broaden my skillset a little. So, I've decided to dive back into something that's always caught my interest: **Solidity and blockchain development**. I'm currently working in the crypto space, am very bullish on the technology, so it seems like a perfect fit to complement my Javascript skills.

## Why Am I Going Back to Solidity?

Blockchain technology has always intrigued me. There's something about its promise for a more secure and transparent digital world that I find compelling. Plus, the technical challenges it presents are the kind you really want to get stuck into.

> Picking a niche isn't just about job prospects; it's about choosing something that keeps you glued to the screen.

## What Have I Done Before?

I've dabbled in Solidity in the past. Completed a few tutorials, even wrote a faucet contract foe developers to request and donate test eth. It was good fun, but for one reason or another I lost focus and spent time enhancing my frontend skills for current work responsibilities . Now, I'm keen to get back to it and go a bit deeper.

## The Plan of Action

I'm hitting the ground running. I'm starting fresh with [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/), an interactive course that teaches Solidity through coding your own zombie game. I have been through the beginner to intermediate course once before, but I think a refresher is a smart starting point. Alongside that, I'm diving into core blockchain concepts.

- Investigating different smart contract applications
- Hands-on work with tools like Truffle and Web3.js
- Building a few small to medium-sized dApps

## What’s Next?

I’ll be sharing my progress as I go along. Expect updates, new findings, and hopefully, some useful resources. If you're on a similar journey or are thinking about diving in, give me a shout.

That's it for now. If the world of smart contracts and dApps excites you as much as it does me, keep an eye out. We're just getting started.


The debate between using spaces and tabs for indentation in coding may seem trivial to the uninitiated, but it is a topic that continues to inspire passionate discussions among developers. This seemingly minor choice can affect code readability, maintenance, and even team dynamics.

Let's delve into the arguments for both sides and consider why this debate remains relevant in the software development world.

## The Case for Spaces

Advocates for using spaces argue that it ensures consistent code appearance across different editors, tools, and platforms. Because a space is a universally recognized character with a consistent width, code indented with spaces will look the same no matter where it's viewed. This consistency is crucial for maintaining readability and avoiding formatting issues when code is shared between team members or published online.

Additionally, some programming languages and style guides explicitly recommend spaces for indentation, suggesting a certain number of spaces (often two or four) per indentation level. Adhering to these recommendations can be essential for projects that aim for best practices in code quality and readability.

## The Case for Tabs

On the other side of the debate, proponents of tabs highlight the flexibility that tabs offer. Because the width of a tab can be adjusted in most text editors, individual developers can choose how much indentation they prefer to see, making the code more accessible and comfortable to read on a personal level. This adaptability can be particularly beneficial in teams with diverse preferences regarding code layout.

Tabs also have the advantage of semantic meaning. A tab is explicitly meant to represent indentation, whereas a space is used for many purposes within code. This distinction can make automated parsing and manipulation of code simpler, as tools can more easily recognize and adjust indentation levels without confusing them with spaces used for alignment.

## Hybrid Approaches and Team Dynamics

The debate often extends into discussions about hybrid approaches, where teams might use tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment within lines, attempting to combine the best of both worlds. However, such strategies require clear team agreements and disciplined adherence to coding standards to prevent formatting chaos.

Ultimately, the choice between spaces and tabs often comes down to team consensus and project guidelines. In environments where collaboration and code sharing are common, agreeing on a standard that everyone follows is more important than the individual preferences of spaces versus tabs. Modern development tools and linters can help enforce these standards, making the choice less about technical limitations and more about team dynamics and coding philosophy.

## Conclusion

While the spaces vs. tabs debate might not have a one-size-fits-all answer, it underscores the importance of consistency, readability, and team collaboration in software development. Whether a team chooses spaces, tabs, or a hybrid approach, the key is to make a conscious choice that serves the project's needs and to adhere to it throughout the codebase. As with many aspects of coding, communication and agreement among team members are paramount to navigating this classic programming debate.
