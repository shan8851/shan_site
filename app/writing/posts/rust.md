## Why Rust?

It's been on my todo list for a long time to learn Rust. Honestly I didn't always have a real *why* which imo was part of the problem and reason for the stop start that has been ongoing.

However, after a little more reflection I do have some reasons that I now feel ok with.

1. **Type Safety** - I started with pure javascript, I was actually resistant to learning Typescript for a little while many moons ago. I didn't really feel I needed it or I guess more accurately didn't fully comprehend the benefits. Nowadays I couldn't imagine creating a `.js` file, so Rust super strong type system will for sure make me a better programmer and write better code.
2. **Multiple Languages** - I have always thought that I should know more than one language well. JS/TS is great, can be used anywhere and this has stunted my progress on this goal for a long time. However I still see real value in picking up and being good with another language and Rust seems like a solid choice. Worth mentioning I do have a decent grasp of Solidity, but this feels very smart contract specific, so I don't really think about it as a second programming language all the time, although of course, it is.
3. **HYPE** - somewhat joking here, but Rust is all the rage and I want to see what all the fuss is about
4. **Blockchain** - I have been in the blockchain space for some time now, many projects are using Rust extensively, being able to work close to protocol/chain level and get my hands dirty there, will be a huge plus for me, just like knowing Solidity and the EVM is.

## So, What's the Problem?

Now I have clear reasons it should be easy right? Well, kinda... The thing is I still have a full time job, still want to keep advancing my EVM and Solidity knowledge, still need to keep up to date with the react ecosystem, not to mention managing family and social life and maintaining some sort of balance there.

In short, it's tough, but imo worth it. I think my biggest issue was the all or nothing approach I started with, where I felt if I wasn't at it multiple hours every day then it was a waste of time. However I am now seeing that although I won't win any races, my approach of little and often is starting to compound.

I think it is another one of those, overestimate the short term and under estimate the long term and as long as I keep plugging away, building little bits here and there it will come. I also slightly tweaked my approach to suit my style.

## My New Approach

The rust docs are great, they have a clear learning path and recommend the book, however for me, it just didn't click. I don't want to read a book back to front. Just like when I first learned to code, I want to learn the things that give me the most bang for my buck.

So now I am trying to keep things domain specific, crypto related and just create a path for myself to build things, increasing complexity and exposure to the language as I go, but with small little projects along the way.

This is what will work for me, as I can see progress, ship things, tinker, iterate etc

## Mentor Needed

Having said all of that, I would love to find myself a mentor who can help validate my plan, point me in the right directions and let me know what to avoid. I think many experienced engineers overlook this when learning something new, but just like it helped in the early years when I knew nothing I know a mentor can help me now too.

I am gonna try find some crypto related projects I can contribute to and make some connections in the rust developer space and hopefully find myself a mentor to accelerate my journey a little.
