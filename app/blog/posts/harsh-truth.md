I've recently been speaking with some of my mentees about how tough the job market is. Don't get me wrong, I don't disagree—things are definitely tough out there. However, that's just the reality. What's more important is how you can navigate this landscape to get hired, promoted, or grow.

> Rather than focusing on the market, focus on yourself and take proactive steps to better position yourself in the market.

## Why Your CV Matters More Than You Think

Firstly, review your CV. With potentially hundreds, if not thousands of applicants for some positions, standing out is key. However, don't be discouraged; the reality is that the vast majority of applicants aren't suitable. Secondly, most CVs are lacklustre. Hiring managers often skim-read your CV, taking only a matter of seconds to decide. Your CV should essentially shout **"DO NOT SKIP OVER ME"** or **"STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND CONTACT ME NOW."**

> Review your CV to ensure it accurately reflects your skill level and provides compelling reasons for hiring managers to contact you.

## The Unspoken Importance of Portfolios

Personal websites and portfolios might not be mandatory, but for a web developer or programmer, not having one seems odd. If you're genuinely passionate about your field, you should be experimenting in your spare time. Document your learnings and projects. They not only showcase your skills but also demonstrate that you are continually working to improve yourself.

> Package your learnings and skills into a portfolio. It's your evidence of ongoing improvement. Even if you don't have fully fledged projects you want to show off, document your journey and put it out there for the world to see!

## Networking: More Than Just a Buzzword

Many developers seeking to enter the industry use the spray-and-pray approach: hitting the 'Quick Apply' button wherever they can. While the job hunt can be a numbers game, stacking the odds in your favour involves more than just application volume. Connect with people at companies you're interested in, engage in meaningful conversations, and build genuine relationships.

> Networking is a strategic exercise. Build meaningful relationships rather than just asking for opportunities.

## The Art of Interviewing

Interviewing is a skill, and like any skill, it improves with practice. Don't postpone applying out of fear. Your first few interviews may be nerve-wracking, but you will get better with time. Even initial phone screenings can provide valuable insights into market demands.

> Start applying and interviewing as early as possible. Information is power!

## Conclusion: The Ball is in Your Court

Yes, the market is tough, but you have the power to make a difference in your own job search. Prioritise honing your skills and improving your marketability.

If you're struggling with any aspect—be it the technical side, the interviewing process, or something else—feel free to reach out. The only thing I ask in return is that you invest the time and effort needed to improve.
