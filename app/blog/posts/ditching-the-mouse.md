As the title suggests, this post is writtin in **vim** so excuse the typos...

I have been on the fence about learning vim for some time now. I have been through `vimtutor` more times than I would like to admit and went back and forth on going all in with neovim etc and replacing other IDEs. Usually I decided against, mostly because I just thought the only reason was just because, which ofc, is dumb.

## Why now?

However, I have been reading the pragmatic engineer lately (great book btw!) and thought more about *sharpening my toolbelt* as it were. I spend a lot of time in the terminal, I am pretty handy with most commands and do all of my git there or if not there in lazygit - another awesome tool btw.


The more actual thought I have given it the better I am with the keyboard the faster I can work etc. With that in mind I have been playing more with `grep`, `bat`, `fzf` and many more in the past week or so and I am already noticing an improvement.

I have decided not to immediately go all in and replicate and IDE in neovim because what's the point... The point for me is to be faster, and the IDE comes with some amazing bells and whistles, but the copy and pasting with the mouse, moving around the file with the cursor is grim and when not working at my desk it is just flat out trash on the built in trackpad of my machine.

## Staggered approach

So, the plan is, to work initially with the vim plugin with vscode. Not sure if I am all in from day 1, as I still have a job to do and as mentioned in my last post that job is pretty tough and demanding! But for sure in side projects, blogging and other bits and pieces I will be 100% keyboard and over time I will hopefully just use it as the daily driver. And at the point I will likely go all in. 

## /brag?

Was this post just the fist of many brags that I am now an expert in vim? Of course not... Mainly because I am far from an expert and it is already painful to watch mysefl fumble around. *What was the point then?* I hear you ask. Honestly? Just because I made a revamp to my site and wanted to see how it looks with a new post there too.

Let me know what you think!

Now let's see how long it takes me to exit vim...
